This is the mid-term BDP2 project

I linked this repo to a dockerHub repo so that as I commit the code my docker container is simultaneously built by dockerHub.
dockerHUb repo --> 

The aim is to extend the jupyter notebook docker to include matblot lib so that i can plot data from the italian covid19 epidemic.
